# Business Images Edge Cases - Implementation Summary

## ✅ All Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Orphaned Storage Files on DB Insert Failure
**Status**: Fixed  
**Location**: `src/app/add-business/page.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- Added cleanup logic that deletes uploaded storage files if DB insert fails
- Handles both error cases and exceptions
- Uses robust storage path extraction utility

**Code**:
```typescript
if (imagesError) {
  // Clean up orphaned storage files
  const { extractStoragePaths } = await import('../../lib/utils/storagePathExtraction');
  const storagePaths = extractStoragePaths(uploadedUrls);
  
  if (storagePaths.length > 0) {
    await supabase.storage
      .from('business-images')
      .remove(storagePaths);
  }
}
```

### 2. ✅ Fragile Storage Path Extraction
**Status**: Fixed  
**Location**: `src/app/lib/utils/storagePathExtraction.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Created centralized utility function with multiple URL pattern matching
- Handles query parameters, URL encoding, and various Supabase URL formats
- Used in all deletion operations

**Features**:
- Multiple regex patterns for different URL formats
- URL decoding support
- Validation that URL is from business-images bucket
- Batch extraction for multiple URLs

---

### 3. ✅ Business Deletion Storage Cleanup
**Status**: Fixed  
**Location**: `src/app/api/businesses/[id]/route.ts` (DELETE endpoint)

**Implementation**:
- DELETE endpoint now deletes all storage files before deleting business
- Uses robust path extraction
- Continues with business deletion even if storage deletion fails (logs warning)

**Code**:
```typescript
// Get all images for business
const { data: images } = await supabase
  .from('business_images')
  .select('url')
  .eq('business_id', businessId);

// Extract and delete storage paths
const storagePaths = extractStoragePaths(images.map(img => img.url));
await supabase.storage.from('business-images').remove(storagePaths);

// Then delete business (CASCADE handles DB records)
```

### 4. ✅ Image File Validation
**Status**: Fixed  
**Location**: `src/app/lib/utils/imageValidation.ts` + `src/app/add-business/page.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- Validates MIME type (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- Validates file size (5MB limit)
- Validates file extension matches MIME type
- Validates file is not empty
- Prevents upload of non-image files

**Features**:
- `validateImageFile()` - Single file validation
- `validateImageFiles()` - Batch validation
- `areAllImagesValid()` - Quick check
- `getFirstValidationError()` - User-friendly error messages

---

### 5. ✅ Concurrent Primary Image Race Conditions
**Status**: Fixed  
**Location**: `supabase/migrations/20250112_business_images_unique_primary_index.sql`

**Implementation**:
- Added unique partial index on `(business_id)` where `is_primary = true`
- Database-level guarantee against multiple primary images
- Works alongside existing trigger

**SQL**:
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX business_images_single_primary
ON public.business_images (business_id)
WHERE is_primary = true;
```

---

### 6. ✅ Storage Quota Error Handling
**Status**: Fixed  
**Location**: `src/app/add-business/page.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- Detects quota-related errors
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Handles bucket not found errors

**Code**:
```typescript
if (uploadError.message?.includes('quota') || 
    uploadError.message?.includes('storage limit')) {
  showToast('Storage limit reached. Please delete old images or contact support.', 'error');
}
```

---

### 7. ✅ Orphaned DB Records Cleanup
**Status**: Fixed  
**Location**: `src/app/lib/utils/orphanedImagesCleanup.ts` + `src/app/api/admin/cleanup-orphaned-images/route.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Utility function to validate image URLs
- Batch processing with configurable batch size
- Admin API endpoint for manual/automated cleanup
- Returns detailed statistics

**Features**:
- `imageExists()` - Validates single image URL with timeout
- `cleanupOrphanedImages()` - Batch cleanup with progress tracking
- Admin endpoint: `POST /api/admin/cleanup-orphaned-images`
- Optional businessId filter

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Upload Flow:
- [ ] Upload valid images → Should succeed
- [ ] Upload invalid file type → Should reject with error
- [ ] Upload file > 5MB → Should reject with error
- [ ] Upload succeeds, DB insert fails → Should cleanup storage files
- [ ] Storage quota exceeded → Should show clear error message

### Delete Flow:
- [ ] Delete single image → Should delete from storage + DB
- [ ] Delete primary image → Should promote next image
- [ ] Delete all images → Should show placeholder
- [ ] Delete business → Should delete all storage files

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] URL with query parameters → Should extract path correctly
- [ ] URL-encoded paths → Should decode correctly
- [ ] Concurrent primary image updates → Should be prevented by unique index
- [ ] Orphaned DB records → Should be cleaned up by admin endpoint

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   # Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
   - supabase/migrations/20250112_business_images_table.sql
   - supabase/migrations/20250112_business_images_unique_primary_index.sql
   ```

2. **Test Upload Flow**:
   - Try uploading invalid files
   - Try uploading files > 5MB
   - Verify cleanup on DB failure

3. **Test Delete Flow**:
   - Delete images and verify storage cleanup
   - Delete business and verify all files removed

4. **Set Up Cleanup Job** (Optional):
   - Schedule periodic cleanup via cron job
   - Call `/api/admin/cleanup-orphaned-images` weekly/monthly

## 🔐 Security Improvements

1. **File Validation**: Prevents malicious file uploads
2. **MIME Type Checking**: Ensures only images are uploaded
3. **Size Limits**: Prevents storage abuse
4. **Extension Validation**: Prevents file type spoofing

---

## 📈 Performance Improvements

1. **Batch Processing**: Orphaned cleanup processes in batches
2. **Timeout Handling**: Prevents hanging requests
3. **Efficient Path Extraction**: Single utility function, no duplication

---

## 🎯 Key Principle Achieved

> **Storage and database state must always be reversible, auditable, and self-healing.**

✅ **Reversible**: Cleanup on failures, proper deletion flows  
✅ **Auditable**: Detailed logging, cleanup statistics  
✅ **Self-healing**: Orphaned cleanup utility, automatic promotion
